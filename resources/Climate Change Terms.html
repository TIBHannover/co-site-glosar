<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Annex I Countries/Parties</h2>
<p class="definition">Group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including all the developed countries in the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, and economies in transition. By default, the other countries are referred to as Non-Annex I countries. Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the Convention, Annex I countries commit themselves specifically to the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Anthropogenic</h2>
<p class="definition">Made by people or resulting from human activities. Usually used in the context of emissions that are produced as a result of human activities.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p class="definition">The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium, radiatively active greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing ratio), and ozone.

<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Atmospheric Lifetime</h2>
<p class="definition">Atmospheric lifetime is the average time that a molecule resides in the atmosphere before it is removed by chemical reaction or deposition. In general, if a quantity of a compound is emitted into the atmosphere at a particular time, about 35 percent of that quantity will remain in the atmosphere at the end of the compound&apos;s atmospheric lifetime. This fraction will continue to decrease in an exponential way, so that about 15 percent of the quantity will remain at the end of two times the atmospheric lifetime, etc. (Some compounds, most notably carbon dioxide, have more complex lifecycles, and their atmospheric lifetimes are not defined by a simple exponential equation.) Greenhouse gas lifetimes can range from a few years to a few thousand years.</p>

<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Black Carbon Aerosol</h2>
<p class="definition">Black carbon (BC) is the most strongly light-absorbing component of particulate matter (PM), and is formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass. It is emitted directly into the atmosphere in the form of fine particles (PM2.5).</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Borehole</h2>
<p class="definition">Any exploratory hole drilled into the Earth or ice to gather geophysical data. Climate researchers often take ice core samples, a type of borehole, to predict atmospheric composition in earlier years. See ice core.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Capture and Sequestration</h2>
<p class="definition">Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a set of technologies that can greatly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing coal- and gas-fired power plants, industrial processes, and other stationary sources of carbon dioxide. It is a three-step process that includes capture of carbon dioxide from power plants or industrial sources; transport of the captured and compressed carbon dioxide (usually in pipelines); and underground injection and geologic sequestration, or permanent storage, of that carbon dioxide in rock formations that contain tiny openings or pores that trap and hold the carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="acronym">CCS</p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Cycle</h2>
<p class="definition">All parts (reservoirs) and fluxes of carbon. The cycle is usually thought of as four main reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange. The reservoirs are the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere (usually includes freshwater systems), oceans, and sediments (includes fossil fuels). The annual movements of carbon, the carbon exchanges between reservoirs, occur because of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth, but most of that pool is not involved with rapid exchange with the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Dioxide</h2>
<p class="definition">A naturally occurring gas, and also a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass, as well as land-use changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal human caused greenhouse gas that affects the Earth&apos;s radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1. See climate change and global warming.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Dioxide Equivalent</h2>
<p class="definition">A metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potential (GWP). Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as &quot;million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMTCO&#8322;Eq).&quot; The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is derived by multiplying the tons of the gas by the associated GWP. MMTCO&#8322;Eq = (million metric tons of a gas) * (GWP of the gas) See greenhouse gas, global warming potential, metric ton.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Dioxide Fertilization</h2>
<p class="definition">The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmospheric CO&#8322; concentration. Depending on their mechanism of photosynthesis, certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO&#8322; concentration.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Footprint</h2>
<p class="definition">The total amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere each year by a person, family, building, organization, or company. A persons carbon footprint includes greenhouse gas emissions from fuel that an individual burns directly, such as by heating a home or riding in a car. It also includes greenhouse gases that come from producing the goods or services that the individual uses, including emissions from power plants that make electricity, factories that make products, and landfills where trash gets sent.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Carbon Sequestration</h2>
<p class="definition">Terrestrial, or biologic, carbon sequestration is the process by which trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide, release the oxygen, and store the carbon. Geologic sequestration is one step in the process of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and involves injecting carbon dioxide deep underground where it stays permanently.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Chlorofluorocarbons</h2>
<p class="definition">Gases covered under the 1987 Montreal Protocol and used for refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, or aerosol propellants. Since they are not destroyed in the lower atmosphere, CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where, given suitable conditions, they break down ozone. These gases are being replaced by other compounds: hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an interim replacement for CFCs that are also covered under the Montreal Protocol, and hydrofluorocarbons, which are covered under the Kyoto Protocol. All these substances are also greenhouse gases. See hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, ozone depleting substance.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Climate</h2>
<p class="definition">Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the &quot;average weather,&quot; or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands of years. The classical period is 3 decades, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. See weather.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p class="definition">Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Climate Feedback</h2>
<p class="definition">A process that acts to amplify or reduce direct warming or cooling effects.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Climate Lag</h2>
<p class="definition">The delay that occurs in climate change as a result of some factor that changes only very slowly. For example, the effects of releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere occur gradually over time because the ocean takes a long time to warm up in response to a change in radiation. See climate, climate change.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Climate Model</h2>
<p class="definition">A quantitative way of representing the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. Models can range from relatively simple to quite comprehensive. See General Circulation Model.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Climate Sensitivity</h2>
<p class="definition">In Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric (equivalent) CO&#8322; concentration. More generally, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in surface air temperature following a unit change in radiative forcing (degrees Celsius, per watts per square meter, &#176;C/Wm-2). One method of evaluating the equilibrium climate sensitivity requires very long simulations with Coupled General Circulation Models (Climate model). The effective climate sensitivity is a related measure that circumvents this requirement. It is evaluated from model output for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the feedbacks at a particular time and may vary with forcing history and climate state. See climate, radiative forcing.</p>

<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Deforestation</h2>
<p class="definition">Those practices or processes that result in the conversion of forested lands for non-forest uses. Deforestation contributes to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations for two reasons: 1) the burning or decomposition of the wood releases carbon dioxide; and 2) trees that once removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis are no longer present.</p>
<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Desertification</h2>

<div class="gloss-term"><h2>El Ni&#241;o - Southern Oscillation</h2>
<p class="definition">El Ni&#241;o, in its original sense, is a warm water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of the intertropical surface pressure pattern and circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon is collectively known as El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation. During an El Ni&#241;o event, the prevailing trade winds weaken and the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, causing warm surface waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward to overlie the cold waters of the Peru current. This event has great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature, and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world. The opposite of an El Ni&#241;o event is called La Ni&#241;a.</p>

<p class="acronym"></p></div>


<div class="gloss-term"><h2>General Circulation Model</h2>
<p class="definition">A global, three-dimensional computer model of the climate system which can be used to simulate human-induced climate change. GCMs are highly complex and they represent the effects of such factors as reflective and absorptive properties of atmospheric water vapor, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, annual and daily solar heating, ocean temperatures and ice boundaries.

<p class="definition">The most abundant greenhouse gas, it is the water present in the atmosphere in gaseous form. Water vapor is an important part of the natural greenhouse effect. While humans are not significantly increasing its concentration through direct emissions, it contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect because the warming influence of greenhouse gases leads to a positive water vapor feedback. In addition to its role as a natural greenhouse gas, water vapor also affects the temperature of the planet because clouds form when excess water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form ice and water droplets and precipitation.

<div class="gloss-term"><h2>Weather</h2>
<p class="definition">Atmospheric condition at any given time or place. It is measured in terms of such things as wind, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and precipitation. In most places, weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the &quot;average weather&quot;, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system. A simple way of remembering the difference is that climate is what you expect (e.g. cold winters) and &apos;weather&apos; is what you get (e.g. a blizzard). See climate.</p>
