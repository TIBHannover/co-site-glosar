# About {.unnumbered}

This is a work in progress demonstration of a workflow for glossary authoring, linked open data storage, multi-format outputting, and use of glossaries for data analysis - for example searching open literature repositories.

More information about the workflow development can be found [here](https://github.com/TIBHannover/semantic-glosar).

A sample Climate Change Terms glossary has been used from the US Environmental Protection Agency,  @epa_climate_2013.
